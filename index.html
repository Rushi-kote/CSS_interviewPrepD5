    <h3>4.What are CSS combinators </h3>
    Combinators combine the selectors to provide them a useful relationship and the
    position of content in the document. This comes in handy when you want to style
    certain elements all at once rather than styling elements individually. CSS
    combinator selectors are as follows.
    <pre>
    1. Descendant Selector (space)
    2. Child Selector (>)
    3. Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)
    4. General Sibling Selector (~)
    </pre>
    <dl>
        <dt>Descendant Selector :
        </dt>
        <dd>The descendant selector matches all elements that are
            descendants of a specified element.</dd>
        <dl>
            <dt>Child Selector :
            </dt>
            <dd> The child selector will only affect elements under a direct
                parent. A good way to remember this is that a child will only listen to its direct
                parents.</dd>
            <dl>
                <dt>Adjacent Sibling Selector :
                </dt>
                <dd>To use the adjacent sibling selector in your CSS
                    stylesheet, you simply need the plus (+) sign. The adjacent sibling selector is used
                    to select an element that is directly after another specific element.
                </dd>
                <dl>
                    <dt>General Sibling Selectors :
                    </dt>
                    <dd>The general sibling selector follows through on all
                        elements under the targeted HTML element selected. This means that if another
                        element tag interrupts the direct adjacent flow, the style rules can still follow
                        through.
                        dd
                </dl>

                <h3>5. What are pseudo selectors in CSS</h3>
                CSS pseudo-classes are used to add styles to selectors, but only when those
                selectors meet certain conditions. A pseudo class is expressed by adding a colon (:)
                after a selector in CSS, followed by a pseudo-class such as "hover", "focus", or
                "active", like this:
                <pre>
                    a:hover {
                        /*add your style here */
                        }
                        Syntax:
                        selector:pseudo-class {
                        property : value;
                        }
                        
                </pre>
